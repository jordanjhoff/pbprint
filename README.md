###PBPrint

A simple state machine to run a homemade photobooth. Each state includes two tightly-coupled GUIs (one for the user control panel, one to display). This software allows users to pay, select one of many photostrip templates, and use the photobooth.

Uses PyQt5 for GUIs, and using CUPS for interacting with photo printer.
